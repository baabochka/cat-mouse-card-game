# Cat and Mouse card game
Card game similar to the Ghost Blitz with different images.

## Rules:
In this game you have 5 answer tokens: orange cat, grey mouse, yellow cheese, blue ball and red pillow.
In each round you will see a card with two objects on it. To find the answer you need to eliminate tokens that contain objects that are on that card, or token has a color that is used on the card. For example, the card is "yellow cat with red mouse" - it means that you cannot choose cat, or mouse - they are on the card. And you cannot use cheese (yellow) and pillow (red), so the answer will be "Blue ball"
There is an exception to this rule - if the card contains the object that colored correctly, that token will be an answer. For example "grey cat on a red pillow" - the answer will be "Red pillow"

In 5-card mode you apply same rules to each card, and the final answer will be the one that repeating twice. For example answers would be "cat", "cheese", "mouse", "cat", "pillow" - "cat" repeats twice, so it will be the final answer.

## Interface:
On the right side you will see a shuffle button, 5 token buttons, and a change of game mode button.
On the bottom you can see a score count and timer.
